--Problem:
    For each day, find the top 3 merchants with the highest number of orders on that day. 
    In case of a tie, multiple merchants can share the same place but on each day, there should always be at least 1 merchant on the first, 
    second and third place.
    Output the date, the name of the merchant and their place in the daily ranking.
