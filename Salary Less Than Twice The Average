--Problem:
     Write a query to get the list of managers whose salary is less than twice the average salary of employees reporting to them. 
     For these managers, output their ID, salary and the average salary of employees reporting to them
       Tables: 
        map_employee_hierarchy
        columns:
        empl_id:varchar
        manager_empl_id:varchar
        
        dim_employee
        columns:
        empl_id:varchar
        empl_name:varchar
        empl_city:varchar
        empl_dob:datetime
        empl_pin:int
        salary:int
